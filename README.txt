We made all the expected features of every game, and all the features suggested at the end of the slides.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Here are the suggested (not mandatory) features:

APPLE CATCHER:
- Apple creation randomized

BRICK BREAKER:
- Background and decorations
- Sci-fi font
- Falling coin (10% chance)
- Randomize the color of each brick

FURAPI BIRD:
- Music and sound
- Speed of the pipes increasing
- Color of the pipes randomized
- All movements stopped when the player dies

-----------------------------------------------------------
Here are some features we added:

APPLE CATCHER:
- The player has 3 lives which he loses when an apple falls

BRICK BREAKER:
- When a brick breaks, it has 5% chance to create a bonus ball (there is a maximum of 3 balls on the screen at a time)
- The player has 5 lives which he loses when there is no more balls on the screen 

CHALLENGE MODE:
This is another choice of game when the player is in the main menu.
It launches a random game amoung the 3 existing. When the player loses at one game it launches another one (random between the two others).
The player has 5 minutes (timer visible on the screen) to get as much points as possible.
